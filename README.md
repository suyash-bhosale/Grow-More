2. **Login Page** (`/login`) - Simple authentication (demo mode)
3. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Register your farm with Google Maps
4. **Monitoring** (`/monitoring/<farmer_id>`) - View real-time satellite analysis

## 🎯 API Testing

### Save Farm Data:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/save-farm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"farmerName": "John Farmer", "phone": "9876543210", "district": "Pune", "crop": "Wheat", "sowingDate": "2024-01-15", "boundary": [{"lat": 18.5180, "lng": 73.8540}]}'
```

### Get Vegetation Indices:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/get-indices/9876543210
```

### Download PDF Report:
```bash
curl -O http://localhost:8080/generate-report/9876543210
```

## 📊 Satellite Data Indices

- **NDVI** (0.0-1.0): Vegetation health and density
- **GNDVI** (0.0-1.0): Chlorophyll content indicator  
- **NDRE** (0.0-1.0): Nitrogen stress detection
- **MSI** (0.0-2.0): Water stress measurement

## 🎨 Key Features
